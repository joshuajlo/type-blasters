# type-blasters
Simple Java game developed in Grade 10 by my friend and I for our final examination project.

In this game, the player is presented with randomly generated words that move across the screen. The player needs to type out the generated word before it reaches the other side of the screen. If the player types the word correctly, they advance to the next level, and the generated words become longer. However, if the player types the word incorrectly, they lose a life. The game continues until the player loses all their lives or reaches level 30.
